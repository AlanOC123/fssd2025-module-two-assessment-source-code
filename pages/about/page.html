            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Supercar Showcase is a curated digital experience for automotive enthusiasts, design purists, and performance dreamers. We bring the world’s most exclusive hypercars, electric marvels, and limited-edition concept vehicles into one immersive, visually-driven platform.

                Our mission is simple: to highlight engineering excellence and bold design through interactive storytelling, clean visuals, and a seamless browsing experience.

                Each vehicle on our platform is more than just a spec sheet — it's a statement. From the aerodynamic lines of the Ferrari SF90 Stradale to the electrified torque of the Lotus Evija-X, we spotlight what makes each machine iconic.

                We built this showcase to celebrate the future of automotive craftsmanship — one pixel, one horsepower, one innovation at a time. Whether you’re here to research, admire, or get inspired, we’re glad to have you on the ride.

            <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you're a designer drawn to bold silhouettes, a gearhead obsessed with torque curves, or just someone who loves beautiful machines, this site was built for you. I created Supercar Showcase to be equal parts visual playground and performance deep-dive — a place where anyone, from curious newcomers to seasoned enthusiasts, can explore the art and engineering behind today’s most extraordinary cars.

                If you're a motorsport fan, you'll feel right at home here. Supercar Showcase was built for those who appreciate not just speed, but the stories behind it — the race-tested tech, the aerodynamic breakthroughs, the relentless pursuit of performance. Whether you're into GT racing, track day engineering, or just love seeing F1-inspired innovation on the road, this site is my tribute to that world — made for fans like you.

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Supercar Showcase was designed with the same principles that define the cars it features: elegance, restraint, and precision. Inspired by the Aston Martin website, every layout, transition, and interaction is intentional — quiet where it should be, dynamic where it matters. The interface avoids unnecessary noise, letting typography, white space, and motion guide the experience naturally. I aimed to create a digital environment that mirrors the feeling of stepping into a showroom: calm, focused, and reverent to the machines on display. Subtle gradients, glass-inspired overlays, and smooth scroll behavior echo the refinement of modern supercar interiors — not just in look, but in feel.
